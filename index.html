									<h2><a href="tableau.html">Tableau Dashboard <br />
									Project </a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I meticulously utilized SQL to refine a comprehensive dataset detailing bicycle sales across the United States, ensuring data integrity through meticulous cleaning and refinement processes. Leveraging Tableau's capabilities, I crafted an executive dashboard adorned with essential metrics crucial for informed decision-making. The dashboard boasts a visually captivating interface, enabling executives to effortlessly navigate through dynamic filters and dissect revenue trends on various time scales. Delving into feature engineering, I uncovered hidden patterns and customer segments, while predictive analytics provided foresight into future sales trajectories, facilitating proactive strategic planning. Robust security measures safeguard sensitive data, while ongoing refinement efforts, coupled with stakeholder feedback, drive continuous enhancement of the dashboard's efficacy and usability. Ultimately, this meticulously curated executive dashboard serves as a beacon of data-driven decision-making prowess, empowering organizational leaders with actionable insights to propel the business forward.

										Financial Reporting & Analysis</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="PowerBI.html" class="image fit"><img src="./images/Finance.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> In this endeavor, I meticulously scrutinized the Balance Sheet of a company, deftly extracting insights to generate comprehensive Sales, Inventory, and Profit and Loss reports. These meticulously crafted reports offer a granular view of the company's financial health and operational performance, and they can be dynamically filtered by country, year, quarter, month, and even daily intervals. Through diligent analysis and calculation, I distilled complex financial data into actionable metrics, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions with confidence.  </p>

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/Sabin247/BikeStore_DB">PL/SQL

										 </a> Project</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Sabin247/BikeStore_DB" class="image fit"><img src="./images/Bike_Rent1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I meticulously crafted SQL code to establish a robust database framework tailored for an online bicycle rental enterprise. Through the creation of multiple tables and the seamless integration of relevant data, I orchestrated a comprehensive repository conducive to efficient operations. Moreover, I leveraged Procedural Language (PL) to implement two pivotal triggers designed to enforce essential business protocols. The first trigger meticulously regulates customer transactions, ensuring that no more than two bicycles are rented simultaneously, thus optimizing resource allocation and maintaining service quality. Meanwhile, the second trigger serves as a safeguard against potential financial risks, swiftly halting bike rentals for users with outstanding balances exceeding $500, thereby safeguarding the company's fiscal integrity and ensuring seamless transactions. </p>

									<p>This project encompasses a rich dataset encompassing customer profiles and their corresponding sales records. Through meticulous crafting of SQL queries, I've devised a sophisticated system capable of extracting pivotal insights into customer behaviors and preferences. The resulting output empowers executives with a deep understanding of their clientele, enabling them to tailor bespoke marketing strategies aimed at amplifying sales and revenue streams. By leveraging this comprehensive understanding of customer dynamics, executives can navigate the market landscape with precision, driving sustained growth and fostering enduring customer relationships.									</p>
